title: Startups are not defensible
category: posts
---

One of the favorite questions startup investors ask is 

_"How is your business defensible? What would prevent competitors from replicating your idea? "_

Next time I'm asked this question, I will probably answer _"NOTHING! "_.

That's right. If you are building a technology business online, it's almost always possible for others to come along and build the same thing. Examples are aplenty, every [successful][desk_com_link] [startup][zendesk_link] has had [competitors][freshdesk_link] who are basically doing the same thing.

The key to building a successful online business is to do things **better**,**cheaper** or **faster**.
