title: Getting Customer Support Right
category: posts
---

Today I was at [the bank][cib] trying to know why something I requested weeks ago wasn't done yet. Nearby, a guy was sitting with a customer representative. It seems the answers to all his questions were a variant of _"this is bank policy, there is nothing I can do about it"_ . While I was waiting for my own problem to be solved, I kept thinking about what people could do to make customer support less painful.

Have Empathy
============

The customer representative sitting with the guy seemed to show no interest in getting his problem solved, this frustrates people. On the contrary, the lady I sat with seemed geniunly unhappy about the fact that my work wasn't done. This disarmed me and made me willing to listen.

Outline a clear escalation path
===============================

Answers like _"we've already emailed the other branch"_ don't cut it. A better solution would be _"I'll get in touch with the person responsible for this and if things don't get finished in a week, we'll involve the branch manager"_ .

Empower customer support
========================

This is the employers' responsibility. Many companies, especially very large ones, give little space to people at the bottom of the hierarchy (those dealing directly with customers) to come up with creative solutions. This leads to a situation where customer support becomes nothing more than someone [nicely parroting canned answers to every question without really offering any solution][dhh_blog].
