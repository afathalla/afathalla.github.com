I frequently ask myself why I didn't do a startup when I was younger, especially during my college days when much time was lost fooling around. I believe a reason fewer young people (i.e. still studying at school/university) create startups is that they that they believe:

- They can't do it without a degree. That somehow graduation instantly confers some kind of knowledge about creating a business that was previously not present.

- That people won't take you seriously if you don't have a degree.

Having some experience with my own [business][usertalk], I can say that both these statements don't really apply to technology startups. I'm glad that more young people are starting to discover that.
